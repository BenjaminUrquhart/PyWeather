**NEW FEATURES/REMOVALS**
* Adds caching and refreshing to PyWeather. After a user-defined amount of time, a cache will expire for certain components of PyWeather, prompting a re-fetch of data. A manual refresh option will also get added, in which a flag is enabled to refresh the cache.
* Removed the dependency on geocoder, and by extension, removed the unnecessary reverse geocoder, and 
* Added the dependency of appJar.
* Loading times have been increased by about 0.2 seconds, due to the removal of the unnecessary second geocoder.
* Added the last-resort option when installing Colorama in the setup file, and a warning to all last-resort options.
* Adds an experimental radar to PyWeather.
* Adds error checking for imports on all scripts (non-standard libraries)
* Adds a progress indicator during setup configuration.
* Adds requests as a necessary library to setup.
* PyWeather Setup now validates your API key after you input it (and after the backup)
* PyWeather Setup will now update PIP packages with user approval.
* Geopy's scheme was changed to HTTP due to issues on OS X.
* Adds wind direction data to historical hourly.
* Removed the keybackup script.

**BUG FIXES**
* Fixed a major bug where the PyWeather Git updater wouldn't, uh, fully update.
* Fixed a bug where configsetup's directory checking wasn't 100% compatible with Windows.
* Fixed a bug where if the sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset hour was 0, PyWeather wasn't correcting it to a 12.
* Fixed a bug where if you entered a weird name to check the weather for, an encoding error would occur.
* Fixed a major bug where alerts wouldn't iterate, due to a non-defined config variable.
* Fixed a super tiny bug where a logger.info statement would not print in the setup file, unless Geopy was not installed.
* Fixed a bug in the setup file, in which if sections were already added to a config file without the configprovisioned flag, PyWeather Setup would not run.
* Fixed a bug in which custom directories really didn't work for the backup API key in the setup script
* Fixed a bug in which PyWeather wasn't properly parsing wind data shown as "Variable". UI changes have been made to accommodate this data type
* Fixed many bugs in which PyWeather was unable to properly catch errors when parsing historical data, and wrong dates.
