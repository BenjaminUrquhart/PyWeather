**WHEN UPDATING FROM 0.6.1 BETA TO 0.6.2 BETA, YOU WILL NEED TO ENTER "2" IN THE INPUT PROMPT (also when you run configupdate separately)**
**THE UPDATER WILL BREAK AFTER YOUR CONFIG IS UPDATED. ENTER "NO", THEN EXIT OUT OF PYWEATHER.**

**NEW FEATURES/REMOVALS**
* Adds the ability to view yesterday's weather. - Thanks to @ModoUnreal for coding this in!
* Adds the ability to view hurricane data in PyWeather.
* Adds the ability to view tide data in PyWeather.
* Adds the manual configuration of 3-day and 10-day hourly cache times. - Thanks to @ModoUnreal for coding this in!
* Fixes a major issue with a geocoder scheme issue. PyWeather can automatically select a geocoder scheme, depending on your OS.
* Adds the ability to input decimal numbers into cache times during setup.
* Adds the ability to manually define a version you're upgrading to in the configupdate script in the event your versioncheck file is gone.
* Removed the configdefault script. The configsetup script has taken it's place now.
* Added up-to-date and no matching version messages in the configupdate script.
* Minor UI updates

**BUG FIXES**
* Fixed a critical bug where if geopy wasn't installed before setup, Pyweather Setup would install geocoder INSTEAD of geopy, and throw an error.
* Fixed a bug where I forgot to globalize variables relating to emptying the radar cache.
* Fixed a bug where if your configuration file failed to load, cache times were set insanely high (5 seconds for alert data, etc)
* Fixed a bug where if you entered nothing for the backup key directory, an error would occur. Thanks to @creepersbane for reporting the error!
* Fixed a bug where if your configuration file failed to load, enter to continue prompts were disabled by default.
* Fixed a bug where the last step in the setup process (bypassing radar confirmation) didn't have proper else catching, and if a "yes" or "no" was entered, PyWeather setup would crash.
* Fixed a bug where you weren't able to exit out of the summary screen when viewing historical data.
* Fixed a bug where wind chill data in celsius in historical hourly displayed "kph" instead of a degree C symbol.
* Fixed a bug where the 10 day forecast cache expire time was running off of the hourly cache time.
* Fixed a bug where PyWeather wouldn't properly catch no moonrise data, resulting in a crash.
* Fixed a bug where if alerts data wasn't getting prefetched at boot, when detailed alerts data was called up PyWeather would crash.
* Fixed a bug where if you had 10-day hourly prefetch enabled at boot, when you viewed detailed 10-day hourly information PyWeather would crash.
* Fixed a potential bug where the configupdate script might not at all work when you manually edit the version info file. It now searches the file instead of an exact match.
* Fixed a bug where yesterday precipitation data could say "T" on the summary screen. A data check has been added.
* Fixing a bug where if some almanac data wasn't available, PyWeather would crash - 80% done. Thanks to @ModoUnreal for reporting the error!
* Fixing a "bug" where if you had no connection to the updater at boot with it enabled, PyWeather would exit instead of continue - 0% done. Thanks to @creepersbane for reporting the error!
* Fixed a potential bug where proper code to catch invalid sunrise/sunset data was not implemented.
