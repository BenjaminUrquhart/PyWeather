; (c) 2017, o355, GNU GPL 3.0
; Welcome to the config file for PyWeather.
; Before making changes, please read through the comments. Thanks!
; Pro tip: The variables here are booleans. Just saying.

[SUMMARY]
; You can choose to show sunrise/sunset times for your area on the summary screen.
; Default: False (to save on API calls)
sundata_summary: False
; You can choose to show almanac data on the summary screen.
; Default: False (to save on API calls)
almanac_summary: False

[VERBOSITY]
; You can tell PyWeather if it should show extra logging information about it's operations.
; Useful for when things go wrong, and you know what you're looking at.
; Default: False
verbosity: False
; You can tell PyWeather to output full .json files in the console.
; Forewarning, doing such will spam your console with a lot of lines of .json file.
; Default: False
json_verbosity: False

[SETUP]
; You can tell PyWeather Setup to show extra information about it's operations.
; Useful for when things go wrong, and you know what you're looking at.
; Default: False (available in 0.4.2)
setup_verbosity: False
; You can tell PyWeather Updater to output full .json files in the console.
; Forewarning, doing such will spam your console with 10 lines of .json file.
; Default: False (available in 0.4.2)
setup_jsonverbosity: False

[UPDATER]
; You can tell PyWeather to check for updates when the program starts. This will check for updates before PyWeather begins.
; As a warning, PyWeather may take <5 seconds to load before you hit the "Input location" field.
; PyWeather will only notify you when an update is available.
; Default: False
autoCheckForUpdates: False (available in 0.4.2)
; You can tell PyWeather Updater (updater/updater.py) to show extra information about it's operations.
; Useful for when things go wrong, and you know what you're looking at.
; Default: False (available in 0.4.2)
updater_verbosity: False
; You can tell PyWeather Updater to output full .json files in the console.
; Forewarning, doing such will slightly spam your console with 2-3 lines of .json file.
; Default: False (available in 0.4.2)
updater_jsonverbosity: False
; You can tell PyWeather Updater to force a version. This is only available in the external script.

; Default: False (available in 0.4.2)
updater_forceVersion: False
; If the above option is True, please specify the forced version text/build number.
; Pro tip: The build number is what PyWeather compares against the updater. The text version is purely cosmetic.
; Default (0.4.2): 42 for the build number, 0.4.2 beta for the text version.
; Pro tip: If you update from git, the updater_forcedReleaseDate is a likely suggestion of when the next version will drop.
