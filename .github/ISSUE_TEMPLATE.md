Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to PyWeather.

It's simply impossible for me to catch every bug in PyWeather, so you can help! Just follow these simple instructions.

- [] Make sure that the bug isn't caused by a mistake you made. Aka don't post an issue about "PyWeather says ImportError for Colorama!" when you don't have it installed.
- [] Make sure the bug truly exists, generally double-checking if necessary libraries are installed, files are placed properly, and replicating the bug multiple times will tell you if the bug is one time or not.
- [] Post the output of the Python interpreter (if it's possible), as I can pretty easily read the interpreter and the mistake I made.
- [] If you want to contribute even more to PyWeather, open a pull request, addressing and fixing the issue.

If you report a true error, you'll get to be on the contributors list for the release in which the bug is fixed in!

(for now, since PyWeather is in active development, that isn't a thing JUST yet...)
