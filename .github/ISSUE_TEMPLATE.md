Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to PyWeather.

It's simply impossible for me to catch every bug in PyWeather, so you can help! Just follow these simple instructions.

- Make sure that the bug isn't caused by a mistake you made. Aka don't post an issue about "PyWeather says ImportError for Colorama!" when you don't have it installed.
- Make sure the bug truly exists, generally double-checking if necessary libraries are installed, files are placed properly, and replicating the bug multiple times will tell you if the bug is one time or not.
- Post the output of the Python interpreter (if it's possible), as I can pretty easily read the interpreter and the mistake I made.
- Additional info (about exact Python version, OS, etc) is always welcome.
- If you want to contribute even more to PyWeather, open a pull request, addressing and fixing the issue.

If you are truly uncertain if you meet these requirements, just post the issue. I generally worry more about the bug than how you post it.

*delete this, and type your issue!*
