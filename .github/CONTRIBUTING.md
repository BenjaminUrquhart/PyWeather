# Contributing to PyWeather

Let's make this simple.

Bug reports? All the detail. No, seriously. All the detail. Make sure it isn't a "you messed up" issue, and you provide every single bit of detail (the Traceback/Error message, OS, version, etc), and I'll get to work on fixing the bug. If you don't have the detail, I can't fix the bug. 

Enhancements? As much detail. Draw me a basic design. I'm visual.

Pull requests? Do it. Follow PyWeather's design and code layout (as can be seen in the code), and I'll handle verisoning and updating the changelog. You do the coding. I do the logistics. If you're doing something off of the todo list, don't do the first thing on said todo list. I will scream and bang my head against an object.

Translations? Don't use Google Translate. Google Translate es muy mal. Generalmente, no usar Google Translate, Bing Translate, Wordreference. Muchas gracias. Don't use online translate services, and don't think you know Spanish from Spanish class. If you're a native speaker, awesome! You can go ahead and translate PyWeather in one of two ways:

* Submit a Pull Request with the modified code. I'll do a quick Google Translate runover, and make sure things are accurate.
* You can look into the code, and wherever you see print() or logger.XXXXX(), translate that text, and submit an issue with all the translated text. I'll put it into a translated version myself!

Documentation? I'll set up read the docs when I feel like it. The wiki will do for now.

Rules? Respect everyone. Everyone. There will be no discrimination on who you are. None of the bad stuff, only positive stuff around here. I'm a positive guy. Respect the rules, respect each other, and I won't have an issue.

Questions? Report an issue, and I'll do my best to answer them in a reasonable time!
