# Contributing to PyWeather

This document isn't done. Sorry.

When contributing to PyWeather, please follow the Code of Conduct, and how you can contribute in a meaningful way to PyWeather.

Please read through this document carefully. If you have any questions, please open an issue with your question.

## Reporting Issuesh
As a solo developer, I can't catch every single issue in PyWeather. To meaningfully report an issue, please follow these guidelines for your different types of reports.

### Bug Reports
To make a successful bug report, be sure to make sure that your bug doesn't contain the following:
* If you don't see a total Python error (usually a Traceback), don't report it. With these bugs, PyWeather has a safety net, and will tell you what you might be doing wrong. However, if you are 100% sure that you aren't doing anything wrong, you may report the issue.
* Make sure you can reproduce the bug 100% of the time, or when reproducing the bug, it happens on a steady interval. Basically, no "this bug happened once and never happened again in weeks" reports. Make sure the bug you're reporting can be reproduced 100% of the time, or happens on a steady interval.
* Turn on verbosity in the code (>0.4.3), or in the config file ( < 0.4.3), and see if anything looks odd.
* When reporting the issue, make sure to include every detail you can. The more details, the easier I can find the bug. When reporting a bug, you'll at least need to include an error output, and steps to reproduce the bug. Information about your OS, something like a video (I'm more visual), and any other details you want to include will help me fix the bug faster.
* Please, for the love of anything, if you have an error log/console output that's 20+ lines, please post it to a site like Pastebin.
* Don't share personal information in issues. If in a video, or detailed output, you input a location, try to not make it your own city, unless the issue happens ONLY in your city. (encoding error)
