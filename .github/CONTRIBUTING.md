# Contributing to PyWeather

**Warning: This document is undergoing renovation. Please excuse our apperance.**

Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to PyWeather. If you don't taking 2 minutes of your day to read this, you'll get the run-down on how things work.

Oh, and quick side note, I'm (o355) am a GitHub novice. This is a learning experience for me, and this will adapt.

## Code of Conduct
When contributing to PyWeather, please make sure to follow the code of conduct, available here: https://github.com/o355/PyWeather/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

## Bug reports
An easy, yet substantial way to contribute to PyWeather is in the form of bug reports. When you create an issue, you'll see an issue template, and this is the general format on how issues are created and formatted. This document will expand on what should ideally be in a report.

### Doing the to-do list
It's really important to run down this list to save your time, and my time from unnecessary reports. This to-do list also includes steps to help your report be the best it can be.

### Reporting indev code
Reporting indev code is ok, under certain circumstances. As mentioned in the issue template, you'll not want to report config errors. At every PyWeather QA, this is automatically tested about 30x on 6 platforms. However, if PyWeather is close to release, and you find a config bug, you'll want to report a config error.

In addition, please don't make a bug report on a feature that's incomplete. However, feel free to report bugs
