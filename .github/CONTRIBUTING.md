# Contributing to PyWeather

Let's make this simple.

When contributing issues, give me as much detail as you can. As much. If you don't give me enough details, I can't accept the report.

Enhancements? As much detail. Draw me a basic design. I'm visual.

Pull requests? Do it. Follow PyWeather's design and code layout (as can be seen in the code), and I'll handle verisoning and updating the changelog. You do the coding. I do the logistics. If you're doing something off of the todo list, don't do the first thing on said todo list. I will scream and bang my head against a wall.

Translations? Don't use Google Translate. Google Translate es muy mal. Generalmente, no usar Google Translate, Bing Translate, Wordreference. Muchas gracias. Don't use online translate services, and don't think you know Spanish from Spanish class. If you're a native speaker, awesome! Translate the translate out of that code.

Documentation? I'll set up read the docs when I feel like it.

Rules? Respect everyone. Everyone. There will be no discrimination on who you are. None of the bad stuff, only positive stuff around here. I'm a positive guy. Respect the rules, respect each other, and I won't have an issue.

Got it? Cool. Now, if you won't mind me...
