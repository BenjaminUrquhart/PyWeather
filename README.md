## Welcome to PyWeather (0.5.2.1 beta)!
Viewing the weather in a terminal has never been so much fun.

## Download/Setup
You can download PyWeather by visiting the releases tab, and getting the latest zip.

You can also use git to download PyWeather, using the commands below.

```
git clone https://github.com/o355/pyweather.git
git checkout 0.5.2.1 beta (if you want indev code, don't perform this command)
```
After that, run setup.py, and the setup file will guide you through setting up PyWeather. After that, run pyweather.py, and enjoy the magic of PyWeather! It's as easy as that.

## What's PyWeather?
PyWeather was a script I made, because I couldn't find anything that I wanted (from a terminal-based weather machine)

1. Not have a library (because arguments suck)
2. Have a simple way to set up the script/library (instead of browsing through about no setup documentation)
3. Have something that actually works!

Alas, PyWeather was born. It's a Python script that let's you view weather data (lots of it), is easy to set up, and it actually works.

## What kind of features are in PyWeather?

*asciinema demo goes here*

(the almanac wasn't included, as I actually found a bug when taking the screenshots)

Even though PyWeather is in beta, it can presently do a lot. Here's what you can easily see in PyWeather.
* A nice "summary" screen for a location
* Detailed current information
* The 36-hour hourly forecast
* The 10 day hourly forecast
* The 10 day forecast
* The almanac
* Sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset/moon data
* Historical data

But that's just half the story. I've also baked in loads of other features, too!
* Color! Lots of color!
* The setup script!
* Verbosity for debugging!
* An updater (it's basic. Quite basic)
* Support for traceback printing!
* A super-configurable config file!
* No arguments!
* API key backups!
* A pretty simple to use UI!

Oh, I should mention that PyWeather is faster than going to Wunderground, is ad-free (duh), and gets loads more data (that's pretty easy to view), and does it all without confusing you.

Need mobile support? You could get Termux, but that doesn't work (tested it). The best option right now is to spin up a Linux box with SSH and PyWeather, and log into it using Termius (iPhone/Android).

PyWeather also has a few easter eggs.

## Contributing
I'm not a full time Python developer. I have school, I work on other projects, and have other hobbies, too (you can thank my love for KSP).

While I try to get in around 60 minutes of coding time a day, 80% of the time, I can't. Thanks school. Thanks. And, sometimes, I just need a break from coding Python, to focus on doing other projects, or spending time with family.

Contributing is the best way to help me out with the limited time I have to code PyWeather. Be it bug hunting, submitting feature ideas, coding parts of PyWeather, or telling me about something I can do better, I'm all for it.

Read over CONTRIBUTING.md in the .github folder to get a general rundown of how things work.

## Sharing
I've poured hundreds of hours into making PyWeather, and have thousands more to pour in. It would be awesome if you could help spread the word about PyWeather, and to let the courage ones know that they can check weather in their terminal.

It's simple. Share the GitHub link. Done.
