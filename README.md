# Welcome to PyWeather (broken)!
A simple-to-use and ~~advanced~~ mildly advanced weather program for Python. 3.

# Explain. More.
At the basic level, PyWeather uses the ~~Dark Sky API~~ Wunderground API to spit out beautiful looking weather forecasts, and helps you set up an API key. It's really cool stuff. Except Wunderground's free API provides about no data whatsoever. Dark Sky provides "JSONs", except it flops out a not JSON file. Whatever.

For the time being, PyWeather will use Wunderground. When I figure out Dark Sky, I'll use Dark Sky. Not using OpenWeatherMap. That just...no. Reading API documentation kills my brain cells at a rate faster than anything could.

# When is it coming?
Late 2017. It's another huge step in my Python carrer, and it involves command-line arguments, colors, learning APIs, and lots of time. However, you can follow the betas that I publish, showing progress.

# How will it eventually work?

First off, PyWeather will ask you for a ~~Dark Sky API~~ Wunderground API key if it can't find it. It'll also install necessary libraries. It'll store this API key in a file, so you're not getting prompted to load an API key every time. From here, PyWeather will ask you to input default locations/units, and every time it launches, it'll pull up a nice looking summary.

The summary will contain ~~any alerts~~, current weather, ~~hourly information~~, and the ~~7~~ 3 day forecast.
