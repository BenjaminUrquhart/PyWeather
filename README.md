## Welcome to PyWeather (0.4 beta)!
Viewing the weather in a terminal has never been so much fun.

## BETA DISCLAIMER:
Even though PyWeather is in beta, it's still in active development. While releases are somewhat stable milestones of PyWeather, things may or may not work. If you update from GitHub, I may push updates that entirely break PyWeather, so please, take caution!

## Why?
Because I'd rather check my weather in a terminal. Unlike 99.98% of humans.

## Setup
I won't make you read the entire readme, so here's how to download PyWeather.

Simple. Download a release from the releases tab, unzip it, and run setup.py. The script will walk you through installing necessary libraries, instructions for retrieving an API key, and making sure things run smooth.

After that, double click termweather.py, input a location, and that's it! No, really. That's actually it. No completed config files, none of that. setup.py, termweather.py. Welcome to the world of simplicity! \ (•◡•) /

***For users using a command-line only OS, make sure you're in the directory you want PyWeather to be stored in, and then run `git clone https://github.com/o355/pyweather.git`. Run the scripts using `python3 setup.py / python3 pyweather.py`. Simple. Effortless.***

## What's PyWeather?
PyWeather is a script I made to accomplish a few things.

1. Make it easy for people to view the weather in Python.
2. Make a fast way for people to view the weather, instead of having to wait for apps on their phone launch.
3. Make a weather script that combines simplicity, and advanced features.

I couldn't find any of this. None. Alas, PyWeather was born.

PyWeather is simple, it'll read you the forecast, and the current weather, but it's also easy to set up. Really easy. Yet, it contains lots of data for reading the almanac, previous weather, whatever. Plus, if you have a PWS from Wunderground, PyWeather (not presently) will let you view the weather for your PWS. Easy style.

Oh, and PyWeather is faster than opening up a web browser, going to the website, and letting it load. There's no ads on PyWeather, none of that.

## Contributing
I need to figure out how to implement contributing. But, you can still report issues!
