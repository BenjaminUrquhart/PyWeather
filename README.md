# Welcome to PyWeather
A simple-to-use and advanced weather program for Python 3. I'm still writing it.

# Where's the development at?
Somewhere. Can't find it. I'm just really busy (well, I always am), and I haven't gotten around to doing more with this program since.

# Why not use the 20 other programs named PyWeather?
Because PyWeather is simple. It'll help you set up an API key. It'll install needed libraries. It does EVERYTHING FOR YOU. It'll give you a step by step by step guide in getting an API key. It's ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. It has alerts. It has hourly forecasts. It has an almanac. It has tide data. It has a weather time machine. It has sunrise/sunset/moonrise/moonset data. It has 10 day forecasts. IT'LL EVEN LIST ACTIVE HURRICANES. It has all the weather data that tickles the weather nerd inside of you.

# When is it coming?
Late 2017 (maybe even 2018). It's another huge step in my Python carrer, and it involves command-line arguments, colors, learning APIs, parsing JSONs, and lots of time. However, you can follow the betas that I publish, showing progress. (around 10 betas will get published). I'm also working on 2 other Python projects, PyTerm and PIPupdate, and I need to develop for those too!

If you want to contribute in any form to PyWeather, submit issues, wiki pages, and pull requests (after 1/15/17).

# How's it coming along?

As of the moment, it's getting there. I'm working on getting the summary screen down (alerts, current conditions, etc), and then I'll move on to more advanced features, like detailed conditions, forecasts, and all the other information.
