## Welcome to PyWeather (0.3.1 beta)!
Viewing the weather in a terminal has never been so much fun.

## BETA DISCLAIMER:
Even though PyWeather is in beta, it's still in active development. While releases are somewhat stable milestones of PyWeather, things may or may not work. If you update from GitHub, I may push updates that entirely break PyWeather, so please, take caution!

## Why?
Because I'd rather check my weather in a terminal. Unlike 99.98% of humans.

## Setup
I won't make you read the entire readme, so here's how to download PyWeather.

Simple. Download a release from the releases tab, unzip it, and run setup.py. The script will walk you through installing necessary libraries, instructions for retrieving an API key, and making sure things run smooth.

After that, double click termweather.py, input a location, and that's it! No, really. That's actually it. No completed config files, none of that. setup.py, termweather.py. Welcome to the world of simplicity! \ (•◡•) /

***For users using a command-line only OS, make sure you're in the directory you want PyWeather to be stored in, and then run `git clone https://github.com/o355/pyweather.git`. Run the scripts using `python3 setup.py / python3 pyweather.py`. Simple. Effortless.***

## What's PyWeather
PyWeather solves the endless pain of not having a good script for fetching weather in Python.

Gone are the days of trying to figure out how to install PIP to your setup, or figuring what libraries a module/script needs. Gone are the days of poor documentation. Gone are the days of having to input a stupidly large amount of arguments to get the weather. Gone are the days of inaccurate weather.

Meet PyWeather. Here to solve all your issues.

PyWeather aims to solve a void in weather scripts. Easy setup, check! Accurate weather through Wunderground, check! PyWeather gives you the weather in one script, no arguments, easy setup. View a summary of the weather, or dive deep into all the weather data.

## No, seriously. What truly is PyWeather?
It's a Python 3 script that shows you the weather in a terminal. It's easy to set up, provides lots of accurate weather data, and let's you go in depth with such weather data, along with getting the basic overview of the weather. 

PyWeather can show current data, hourly data, forecast data, and...well...that's it. But, given some time, PyWeather will soon be able to do the following:
* 10-day hourly forecasts
* Almanacs
* Sun/moon rise and set data
* Historical data
* Alerts
* Radar/satellite images
* Specific PWS information
* Tide data

By time, I mean hundreds of hours of coding. Coding takes time. But coding is also the most productive time killer ever.

Oh, and PyWeather is faster than going to Wunderground, by about 4x. It's a little slower versus going to Google, but it gives you more data!

## I'm having errors! Please help!
GitHub issues exists. Post your errors there!

(if you open PyWeather by double clicking the script, the window auto-closes when an error occurs. be sure to run PyWeather in a command prompt to view the error!)

## Contributing
Since I'm a solo developer, in which I'm forced to devote 33% of my life to school, 25-30% of my life to sleeping (and dreaming about coding), that leaves me with about 40% of my life (akin to 8-10 hours) of "free time". However, in said free time, I can't always work on PyWeather, as I have other projects to work on, and homework/other non-tech stuff to do. If you'd like to contribute, get something off of the to-do list (not the first item, please!), develop it, submit a pull request, and you'll be eternally thanked! ( ﾟヮﾟ)

If you don't know how to code Python, bug test the program! Test every aspect of the program, and report issues if you find something. Doing such will also get yourself eternally thanked for your contribution. 

I'll soon open the door to Wiki contributing/translations, but not yet. I still need to figure out the logistics of that.
