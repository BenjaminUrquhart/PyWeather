## Welcome to PyWeather
A simple-to-use and advanced weather program for Python 3. I'm still writing it.

## USAGE DISCLAIMER:
PyWeather is presently in development, and I'm pushing new development changes to GitHub, to the master branch. Some of these commits will contain unfinished/rough parts, may randomly add/take away verbosity, and/or reduce stability. Please take heed when using PyWeather and the fact that it's in development.

## Setup
I won't make you read the entire readme, so here's how to download PyWeather.

**These instructions will apply to code I publish soon. This banner will go away when I finish the setup script.**

Simple. Download a release from the releases tab, unzip it, and run setup.py. The script will walk you through installing necessary libraries, instructions for retrieving an API key, and making sure things run smooth.

After that, double click pyweather.py, input a location, and that's it! No, really. That's actually it. No completed config files, none of that. setup.py, pyweather.py. Welcome to the world of simplicity!

***For users using a command-line only OS, make sure you're in the directory you want PyWeather to be stored in, and then run `git clone https://github.com/o355/pyweather.git`. Run the scripts using `python3 setup.py / python3 pyweather.py`.***

## What's PyWeather?
PyWeather is a script that, as it says, shows the weather. In addition, PyWeather is pretty, includes a setup script for guidance on setting up PyWeather, and PyWeather provides detailed weather information, along with the short and simple version.

PyWeather can show you the conditions outside your window, how things may look outside your window in a few hours (and with detail!), and how things may look outside your window in a few days (with detail, of course!). PyWeather will soon be able to show alerts information, almanac data, and loads of other data from Wunderground.

## Why not use the dozens of other programs named PyWeather, etc?
Great question! What I generally found after scanning GitHub was that those programs showed data through command prompts, didn't contain stupidly easy-to-follow instructions on retrieving an API key, but they weren't a script. You had to have knowledge over how to set up Python libraries, bleh. PyWeather was aimed for people who just wanted the weather, but through Python. 

And for those users using a command prompt as their OS, PyWeather is simply perfect for viewing the weather in a terminal.

## Are there any TRUE advantages over PyWeather than going to Google/Wunderground?
Sure! PyWeather is about 3-4x faster than pulling up a web browser, and going to Wunderground. It's a little slower when it compares to going to Google (or your preferred search engine), but fetches more data. Best of all, PyWeather is ad-free, and doesn't track you. PyWeather just wants to serve you the weather.

## What's still coming?
Lots! I'm still developing the base version of PyWeather, so more data will be fetched, and along the way, I may make some other changes.
