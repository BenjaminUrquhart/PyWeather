## Welcome to PyWeather (0.4.1 beta)!
Viewing the weather in a terminal has never been so much fun.

## BETA DISCLAIMER:
Even though PyWeather is in beta, it's still in active development. While releases are somewhat stable milestones of PyWeather, things may or may not work. If you update from GitHub, I may push updates that entirely break PyWeather, so please, take caution!

## Why?
Because I'd rather check my weather in a terminal. Unlike 99.98% of humans.

## Setup
I won't make you read the entire readme, so here's how to download PyWeather.

Simple. Download a release from the releases tab, unzip it, and run setup.py. The script will walk you through installing necessary libraries, instructions for retrieving an API key, and making sure things run smooth.

After that, double click termweather.py, input a location, and that's it! No, really. That's actually it. No completed config files, none of that. setup.py, termweather.py. Welcome to the world of simplicity! \ (•◡•) /

***For users using a command-line only OS, make sure you're in the directory you want PyWeather to be stored in, and then run `git clone https://github.com/o355/pyweather.git`. Run the scripts using `python3 setup.py / python3 pyweather.py`. Simple. Effortless.***

## What's PyWeather?
PyWeather is a script I made to accomplish a few things.

1. Make it easy for people to view the weather in Python.
2. Make a fast way for people to view the weather, instead of having to wait for apps on their phone launch.
3. Make a weather script that combines simplicity, and advanced features.

I couldn't find any of this. None. Alas, PyWeather was born.

PyWeather is simple, it'll read you the forecast, and the current weather, but it's also easy to set up. Really easy. Yet, it contains lots of data for reading the almanac, previous weather, whatever. Plus, if you have a PWS from Wunderground, PyWeather (not presently) will let you view the weather for your PWS. Easy style.

### What kind of data does PyWeather show?

Oh, and PyWeather is faster than opening up a web browser, going to the website, and letting it load. Seriously. I check my weather in PyWeather now.

Pro tip: If you're on mobile, and have a Linux box with SSH, get the Termius app (iPhone/Android). A) It's the best SSH/Telnet app for mobile, B) It's fast at launching/connecting, so you can check weather on your phone in more-or-less the same amount of time. A full guide to configuring SSH (for Ubuntu/Debian because I've only used those OSes) is in the Wiki.

## Contributing
I'm not a full time Python developer, and I can't skip school (I need to learn). Between school, my other life projects (e.g. administering web servers, and creating other servers), and gaming on the weekends, and sleeping (I wish I didn't have to sleep), I don't have tons of Python development time. While during the week, I try to squeeze in 30-60 minutes of coding time a day, it isn't enough. That's why you can go ahead, and contribute to PyWeather.

Read over contributing.md in the .github folder to get a general rundown of how things work. After that, do your thing! Bug test, translate, submit some pull requests, you get the idea. Every contribution, bug report, etc, will get thanked in a release changelog!
