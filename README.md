## Welcome to PyWeather - Dark Sky Edition.
A port of PyWeather for Dark Sky. Coming never.

## When's it coming?
You know what, possibly. I read this in the ToS...

Can I require my users to sign up for a developer's API key?

No, your end-users should not sign up for Dark Sky API keys: the API key should be associated with your app or service, not your users.
The 1,000 free calls per day are intended to facilitate personal use and application development, not to provide free weather data to your app. It costs us money to develop and maintain the infrastructure that supports the Dark Sky API. If your application were to grow in popularity, we would have to pay for the use of resources necessary to handle increased traffic (to the benefit of your service and your users) without the financial means to support it. For this reason, applications that ask users to register for an API key are prohibited by our terms of service.

Yet, if I never ask for a user to sign up for a key, that means I'm not violating the ToS! So, maybe. In 2019.
