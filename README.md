# Welcome to PyWeather (broken)!
A simple-to-use and advanced weather program for Python. 3.

# Explain. More.
At the basic level, PyWeather uses the ~~Dark Sky API~~ Wunderground API to spit out beautiful looking weather forecasts, and helps you set up an API key. It's really cool stuff.

# When is it coming?
Late 2017. It's another huge step in my Python carrer, and it involves command-line arguments, colors, learning APIs, and lots of time. However, you can follow the betas that I publish, showing progress.

# How will it eventually work?

First off, PyWeather will ask you for a ~~Dark Sky API~~ Wunderground API key if it can't find it. It'll also install necessary libraries. It'll store this API key in a file, so you're not getting prompted to load an API key every time. From here, PyWeather will ask you to input default locations/units, and every time it launches, it'll pull up a nice looking summary.

The summary will contain any alerts, current weather, hourly information, and the 7 day forecast.

Beyond that? Haven't thought about how to implement different locations, and digging deep. I might use command-line arguments, or have options in the UI to dive deep into hourly/daily information
